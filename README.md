### Hi there, I'm Thomas ğŸ‘‹


## I'm a fullstack web developer based in Paris.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on different project!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything (I'm very curious) ğŸ¤£
- ğŸ‘¯ I love collaborate with other people
- ğŸ¥… 2020/2021 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects (maybe create my own ?)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to draw, to do sports and chilling with Lofi Music (it's like a drug for me)
